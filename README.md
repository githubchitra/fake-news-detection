# Fake News Detection Model

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to detect fake news articles based on text data. The model uses a pre-trained machine learning classifier to determine whether a news article is likely to be true or false.

The Fake News Detection Model classifies news articles as "real" or "fake" based on a variety of linguistic features. It analyzes the content of news articles, including text vectorization and Logistic Regression algorithm, to detect patterns commonly associated with fake news.

This model has been trained on a variety of datasets that include both fake and real news sources. The modelâ€™s goal is to help identify and prevent the spread of misinformation online.

Overview
The Fake News Detection Model uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning technique to classify news articles as either real or fake. The model is capable of distinguishing fake news from factual articles. The model uses text data to predict the credibility of news articles, making it an essential tool to combat misinformation in the digital age.

The model is optimized for news articles but can be adapted for other types of textual data to identify misleading or biased information.
