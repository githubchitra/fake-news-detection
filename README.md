# Fake News Detection Model

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to detect fake news articles based on text data. The model uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a pre-trained machine learning classifier to determine whether a news article is likely to be true or false.

The Fake News Detection Model classifies news articles as "real" or "fake" based on a variety of linguistic features. It analyzes the content of news articles using advanced machine learning techniques, including text vectorization and supervised learning algorithms, to detect patterns commonly associated with fake news.

This model has been trained on a variety of datasets that include both fake and real news sources. The modelâ€™s goal is to help identify and prevent the spread of misinformation online.
